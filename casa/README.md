### Cambio - The Open Cryptocurrnecy Trading Platform

Cambio started off as an experiment that became an obsession. Towards the end of 2017, the cryptocurrency boom was moving into fifth gear. But it was difficult for New Zealanders to buy cryptocurrencies like Ethereum with NZ dollars. I created Cambio as a trading platform to solve that issue. My vision is for Cambio to be an open and safe market for buyers and sellers.

### What is Cambio?

Cambio is... incomplete. So it is not live! What you have here in this repository is database schema, a Rust backend, and a frontend in React. You can do some basic operations such as signing up and placing an order. An exchange is a complex system and there are a lot of open tickets to implement.
